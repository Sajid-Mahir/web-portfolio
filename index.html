            <p class="section-desc">
                I am a learner and an aspiring Developer/Educator. The reason I aspire to be in two professions is that I one day want to teach students at my university, 'Brac University', and also go on with my interest in 'Web Development'. Currently, I am studying in the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Brac University as an Undergraduate student with only left to finish my Final Thesis. For work experience, I was appointed as a Student Tutor (ST/TA) in the CSE department of BracU for more than a year, teaching and helping students in the courses CSE260: Digital Logic Design and CSE110: Programming Language I. To add to that, I have also worked in a startup called 'InstantKaj.com' as a Content Designer (Intern) for 6 months. Besides these for Voluntary work experience, I was the Director of Press Release and Publications Department of BRAC University Computer Club (BUCC), I was the Peer Mentor of two groups of students in the department of CSE, BracU, working under the Office of Academic Advising (OAA), and I was also one of the Volunteers for the 15th Convocation of Brac University, etc. Last but not least, for hobbies, I love to hear Indie music, Watch series, and watch anime.
